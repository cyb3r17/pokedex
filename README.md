# Pok√©dex
All my AI experiments related to Pok√©mon

## üßæ About  
This repo is a playground for building and training neural networks themed around Pok√©mon.  
Think: CNNs for classifying Pok√©mon images, LLMs that chat like a Pok√©dex, or RL agents that learn to play Pok√©mon games.  
The goal is to learn AI/ML deeply‚Äîby building cool stuff.

### Supervised Learning  
- CNN for Pok√©mon image classification  
- A tiny LLM for pokemon trivia
- LLM type classification

### Unsupervised Learning  
- K-Means clustering Pok√©mon based on stats/type    
- GANs for generating Pokemon images

### Reinforcement Learning  
- RL agent to beat Pokemon Red

### Additional experiments
- Multi-modal LLM, i.e. vision LLM
- RLHF on said LLM
- RAG based system for retreiving Pokemon info
